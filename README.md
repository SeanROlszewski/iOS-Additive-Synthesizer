iOS Additive Synthesizer
========================

An additive synthesizer implemented in Objective-C and CSound to demonstrate the Csound for iOS API for Dr. Richard Boulanger's Audio Programming class at Berklee College of Music. 

This differs from the program from Week 12 in [my Audio Programming in C assignments](https://github.com/SeanROlszewski/AudioProgrammingInC). It has a different interface and is substantially stabler.
